# SMA-Strategy-Backtester
This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that allows traders and investors to backtest Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategies. The app enables users to test a classic technical analysis approach where buy and sell signals are generated when a fast SMA crosses above or below a slow SMA.
